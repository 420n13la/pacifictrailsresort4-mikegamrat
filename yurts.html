<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

  <dt><b>What is a yurt?</dt></b>
  <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feer off the ground.  Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
  <dt><b>How are the yurts furnished?</dt></b>
  <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.  Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.  Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
  <dt><b>What should I bring?</dt></b>
  <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.  It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
